Another requirement ([Fast Map Matching for py3](https://github.com/John-Ao/fmm)) can be installed as follows:

- Install:

```bash
apt install libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev gdal-bin libgdal-dev make cmake libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev swig python-dev
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local && make -j32 && make install
```

- Test:

```bash
cd ../example/python && python fmm test.py
```

## File Description

### code

All the .py and .ipynb codes for how we generate the trajectory dataset based on visual embedded traffic camera records, evaluate the vehicle Re-ID and trajectory recovery metrics, and report statistical characteristic.

For details, see the README in this directory.

### dataset

The .csv files as the proposed dataset.

### example

A .ipynb example on the basic usage of the proposed dataset.
